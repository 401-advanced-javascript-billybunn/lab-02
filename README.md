=================================================

#### Notes for grading:
I finished the objects/ folder but not the list/ folder. I've got a few methods working in the `list` constructor, but not all of them. Need to add some more documentation (and JSdocs) below as well.

### Modules - `objects/`
_Vehicles_
#### `vehicle-constructor.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses constructors to build Car and Motorcycle objects. These constructors inherit properties/methods from a Vehicle constructor using prototype inheritance.

#### `vehicle-class.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses classes to build Car and Motorcycle objects. These classes inherit properties/methods from a Vehicle parent class. 

#### `vehicle-factory.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses object factories to build Car and Motorcycle objects. These factories "inherit" properties/methods from a Vehicle function.


_FlyingVehicles_
#### `flyingvehicle-constructor.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses constructors to build Airplane and Helicopter objects. These constructors inherit properties/methods from a FlyingVehicle constructor using prototype inheritance.

#### `flyingvehicle-class.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses classes to build Airplane and Helicopter objects. These classes inherit properties/methods from a FlyingVehicle parent class. 

#### `flyingvehicle-factory.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses object factories to build Airplane and Helicopter objects. These factories "inherit" properties/methods from a FlyingVehicle function.


_SeaCreatures_
#### `seacreature-constructor.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses constructors to build Fish and Lobster objects. These constructors inherit properties/methods from a SeaCreature constructor using prototype inheritance.

#### `seacreature-class.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses classes to build Fish and Lobster objects. These classes inherit properties/methods from a SeaCreature parent class.

#### `seacreature-factory.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses object factories to build Fish and Lobster objects. These factories "inherit" properties/methods from a SeaCreature function.

### Modules - `list/`
_add modules for list folder here_

###### `foo(thing) -> string`
Usage Notes or examples

###### `bar(array) -> array`
Usage Notes or examples

### Setup
#### `.env` requirements
* `npm i` - install dependencies

#### Running the app
* `node objects/index.js`
* `node list/index.js`

#### Tests
* `npm test` to run tests
* **Assertions**: _to do_
* **Assertions to be made**: _to do_
