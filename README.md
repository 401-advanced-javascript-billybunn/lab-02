### Modules - `objects/`
_Vehicles_
#### `vehicle-constructor.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses constructors to build Car and Motorcycle objects. These constructors inherit properties/methods from a Vehicle constructor using prototype inheritance.

#### `vehicle-class.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses classes to build Car and Motorcycle objects. These classes inherit properties/methods from a Vehicle parent class. 

#### `vehicle-factory.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses object factories to build Car and Motorcycle objects. These factories "inherit" properties/methods from a Vehicle function.


_FlyingVehicles_
#### `flyingvehicle-constructor.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses constructors to build Airplane and Helicopter objects. These constructors inherit properties/methods from a FlyingVehicle constructor using prototype inheritance.

#### `flyingvehicle-class.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses classes to build Airplane and Helicopter objects. These classes inherit properties/methods from a FlyingVehicle parent class. 

#### `flyingvehicle-factory.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses object factories to build Airplane and Helicopter objects. These factories "inherit" properties/methods from a FlyingVehicle function.


_SeaCreatures_
#### `seacreature-constructor.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods
Uses constructors to build Fish and Lobster objects. These constructors inherit properties/methods from a SeaCreature constructor using prototype inheritance.

#### `seacreature-class.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods

### Modules - `list/`






###### `foo(thing) -> string`
Usage Notes or examples

###### `bar(array) -> array`
Usage Notes or examples

### Setup
#### `.env` requirements
* `PORT` - Port Number
* `MONGODB_URI` - URL to the running mongo instance/db

#### Running the app
* `npm start`
* Endpoint: `/foo/bar/`
  * Returns a JSON object with abc in it.
* Endpoint: `/bing/zing/`
  * Returns a JSON object with xyz in it.
  
#### Tests
* How do you run tests?
* What assertions were made?
* What assertions need to be / should be made?
